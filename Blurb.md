# Seeing Communities and social groups as systems



<!--I still don't know whether to use community or social groups, need some advice on this-->

More and more working with communities (or social groups) is becoming a large part of our practice as designers. We are switching from an individalistic human centred design framework to one that incorporates the strength of communities and exisiting knowledge. But with this increase in exposure to social groups requires our designs to take into account social group structures and incorporate them into our designs. If you are incorporating systems design tools it can help to take a systems minded approach  to  understanding communities, not only as subject, but also within your own context of work.



In this workshop I'm proposing a systems model of social grouping that helps to catagorise varous aspects of the construction of the group, the connections between a group and it's members, and the value community has to those members. Through the short workshop you well be given the oppertunity to reflect on your own experiences with social groups, and in a group, develop a framework for a community, and if time allows, see how these frameworks handle conflict with other communities
