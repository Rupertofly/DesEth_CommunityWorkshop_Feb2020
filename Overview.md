### Personal Community Prompt

Have a think about the social groups you've been a part of. These could be a school friend group, an office, a meetup organisation, a family, or even a particularly communicative plane row. Once you've thought about one (or a few) look at these catagories and write down the answers for the community, (or couple of communities).

- What was the shared Identity of your group? What brought you together? Why were/are you part of this community as opposed to someone else?
- What shared knowledge and practice/rituals did you have? What were the in-jokes?
- How did the group organise? Who was in charge? How did you make decisions?
- How adaptable was the group? was it's membership constantly changing? was it's structure often changing or adapting?
- What is the groups history? how long has it been around? what is it's legacy? was it grounded in tradition, or free from old values and prejudices?

Then think about what about this group attracted you to it.

- Did you feel a sense of belonging? was the group's identity closely aligned with your own, or did you feel like the group was a key part of your own identity? Did the group represent something you idolised?
- What influence did you have over the group? Did you have a lot of control over the group? Did it empower you and make you feel more confident? Do you feel heard and that you're membership is important to the group.
- Does the community fulfill a particular need for you? this could be:
  - Identity: Being a part of this community is part of my identity, membership alone fulfills need. (ie. being a member of a sports team or fan club might apply a certain identity which you desire)
  - Emotional: This community is an emotional resource for me, I can connect to it's members, be heard, and understood and empathised with. (ie. support communities (AA, NA, etc.), families (sometimes) friendship groups)
  - Attention: This community gives me access to someone's (or the whole group's) attention that I wouldn't be able to capture if I was not a member (fan clubs/networks, artist collectives).
  - Empowering: This community enables me to do things that I wouldn't be able to do alone (professional bodies, unions, workplaces)
- Are you emotionally invested in this community? Does it's survival and prosperity represent an emotional consideration for you?

### Group Community Prompt

If everone sitting at your table was part of group or community of some description, how would you want that group to be organised. Think about your groups from before and what attracted you to them. You're group doesn't have be feasible, or even make sense (you could be a spaceship of astronauts if it fits your collective community needs). As everyone is different you may have to compremise on different community aspects. But the aim is to create something that everyone in your group would be comfortable being part of, so do the best to be true to yourself and make sure to check in with everyone. If you finish long before everyone else, try devising a narrative to work out how your group came to be and how it would overcome hardships and challenges.
